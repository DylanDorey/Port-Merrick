# Port Merrick
This scene is a replication of the island, "Port Merrick" from the game Sea of Thieves made by Rare. The scene was worked on by four developers in charge of different tasks. Development took place over 6, 1 week sprints and the duties were as follows:

- Nathon Polling - Team Lead / Prop Modeler
- Brad Farris - Programmer / Terrain Editor
- Christopher Alvarado - Texturer / Nature Modeler
- Dylan Dorey - Set Modeler / Programmer

As the Set Modeler, my job is to create the significant assets located in the scene. For Port Merrick, my job was to create the foundation modular set, sloop, and buildings. I also did some programming work in the Unity scene for the fishing mechanic, harpoon, and explosive barrel.
